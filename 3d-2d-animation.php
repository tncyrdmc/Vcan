                <h2>2D ANIMATION</h2>
                <p>2D animation is a rapid display of a series of images that are viewed one after the other at a very fast pace. This creates an illusion of moving pictures. Our animators have the capability to create animations for short video films, movies, serials, e-learning sites, games and others.</p>
                <p>2D Design has helped to simulate actions and movements that give the user a realistic experience. To animate means communicate feelings through story telling.</p>
