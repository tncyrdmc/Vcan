                <p>Our website development process is in the making -- structured for efficiency and high-quality output. We start with a website specifications document, ensuring your requirements are outlined and communicated to our team at the start, and follow-through with extensive quality assurance testing.</p>
                <p>We also use a unique framework to streamline our website development process and it’s designed to be scalable, customisable, and secure. It helps ensure consistent output and allows us more bandwidth to support you.</p>
                <p>Want to be kept in the loop? During the Development Phase, we’ll create a development environment for your work-in-progress website so you can monitor our progress in real-time, while having an available test environment for your website training. This is just one of the many ways we approach websites differently.</p>
                <p>We provide personalisation features in the website which allows the user to modify the website according to their desire and requirements. Our approach is to understand your company's goals and objectives for the websites. We believe that website must be simple ,beautiful and user friendly.</p>
                <p> Our Vcan team takes into consideration several security issues, like knowledge entry error checking through forms, filtering output, and encoding. Scripts is exploited to grant unauthorised access to malicious users attempting to gather data like email addresses, passwords and guarded content like master card numbers.
